## Introduction
The goal of this tool is to do calculations about commodities to help you make the best decision to get the most credits.

But this tool is useless for some players who dominate some sectors, have countless raw materials and have very high GPL, which make them produce level *5* commodity (always the most profitable) as easy as possible. The only restrictions for them are "Game mechanism". I hope at least this tool can give them some inspirations and I will appreciate it if they can give some advice on this tool to help it and me improve.

Also, this tool may still have bugs and ambiguous parts and can be greatly improved, in effiency and function, which I will be glad if you point out. :)

Notice that
- This tool, currently, only considers items in the Constants `COMMODITIES`.
- This tool treats `ghodium` and `ghodium_melt` like normal minerals, such as `hydrogen` and `reductant`.
- This tool uses <code>_getPrice(commodity)</code> to get the price of commodity in the market. Since the evaluation of value is very complex and differs for different players, it only evaluates the current value of commodity by taking `avgPrice`, but you can modify this function as you like to be more scientific and rational. For example, taking `transactions` and `volume` into account, or get the random price between `avgPrice - stddevPrice` and `avgPrice + stddevPrice`.
- In the [API](#..API) part, all exposed functions have a line of description which estimates their **CPU** cost.
- For those who want to rewrite this tool, every inner method also has documentation written in the form recognizable by `jsdoc`.
- It is ***important*** to check the **Example** before going to the **API**, because I explain many details in the **Example**.

### MarketCal.commodity.rawComponent(commodity, [settings]) ⇒ [<code>CommodityInformation</code>](#CommodityInformation) \| <code>Number</code>
This function is mainly used for calculating the components to produce the commdity. 

It is, in most cases, useless, but it can give you a glimpse about how many resources are needed to produce that treasure.

This function is ***cheap***.

**Kind**: exposed method of [<code>MarketCal.commodity</code>](#marketCalculator)  
**Returns**: [<code>CommodityInformation</code>](#CommodityInformation) \| <code>Number</code> - Object | ERR_INVALID_ARGS | ERR_MAX_ITERATION_REACHED  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| commodity | <code>String</code> |  | Commodity. |
| [settings] | <code>Object</code> |  | Settings. |
| [settings.amount] | <code>Number</code> | <code>1</code> | The amount of commodity. |
| [settings.stopArr] | <code>String[]</code> | <code>[]</code> | Array of resources. The result will be shown based on these resources and basic resources. |
| [settings.maxIteration] | <code>Number</code> | <code>1024</code> | The maximum calculation iteration number. |

<a name="marketCalculator..revenue"></a>

### MarketCal.commodity.revenue(commodity, [settings]) ⇒ [<code>Revenue</code>](#Revenue) \| <code>Number</code>
This function is used to calculate the expected revenues of producing the commodity based on information about resources, which I will give more details in the examples.

Notice that:
- This function will return `ERR_NO_DATA` if the commodity itself does not have price in the market, no matter how the `settings.ignoreNoData` is.
- This function will calculate based on storage, terminal you have by default, if you set `settings.existenceBased` = true.
- `settings.stopResources` can exist with your storing information. But all the information about resources will be added. Be careful!

This function can be ***expensive***, but mostly ***cheap***.

<a name="marketCalculator..component"></a>

### MarketCal.commodity.component(commodity, [settings]) ⇒ [<code>CommodityInformation</code>](#CommodityInformation) \| <code>Number</code>
This function is mainly for calculating the **additional** components of commodity.

Notice that 
- This function will calculate based on `storage`, `terminal` by default, if you set `settings.existenceBased` = true.
- `settings.stopResources` can exist with your storing information. But all the information about resources will be added. Be careful!

This function can be ***expensive***, but mostly ***cheap***.

<a name="marketCalculator..bestCommodity"></a>

### MarketCal.commodity.bestCommodity([stopResources], [settings]) ⇒ [<code>BestCommodity</code>](#BestCommodity)
This function will calculate the most profittable commodity you can produce **(only 1)**.

You may think it will be much more useful to take multiply commodities into account. Or, at least, calculate the maximum amount you can produce of this most profitable commodity.

But if we take `battery` into account, you will find this commodity usually has stable supply and demand (not like level 5 *Commodity*). And its component, namely `energy`, is extremely easy to harvest. So, in this case, if we allow the amount to be more than 1, the result of calculation will usually be `battery`, given that it is usual the case player has much energy in their storage, but few high level commodities, which will lead to "covering" the high level commodities. And if you want to avoid this, you need to pass in complicated parameters to avoid this, which is also unavoidable for this function, since its duty is to calculate the most profitable commodity.

So, considering above, I decide to make this function only to calculate one.

Notice that 
- This function will **not** consider those commodities which require some resources lacking market data (shortage of supply), that you do not have either.
- This function will not detect the situation of your factorys' level by default, but you can turn it on by let `settings.detectLevel` = true.
- This function will calculate all categories (including *metal*, *silicon*, *mist*, *biomass*, *compressed*, *basic(metal, crystal, liquid)* ) commodities by default, this can be time-consuming and waste **CPU**, given you just harvest and produce one type of commodity, you can change it in `setting.series`.
- This function will not take the cooldown time into account when evalutes the revenue of commodity by default, since it's usual the case for most players that the restriction of producing commodities is GPL, which makes the factory idle in most times.

This function is usually ***expensive***.
